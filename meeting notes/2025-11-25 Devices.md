* receices events from mqtt and drive-u
* the events actually go through AWS IoT
	* Name: prod_C10942
* device-state-processing-{prod|staging} queue name
* The go services also listen to this queue: sqs_heartbeat_consumer.go
* Motivation: [MDS requirement](https://www.notion.so/MDS-Designing-on-exposing-live-data-about-coco-robots-and-correlated-events-2aa86fd0dcab80cdb0b2f6e95a059bb5)
	* Right now, MDS endpoint exposes some amount of our activity but it doesnt include realtime device data
	* Rafal proposed multiple alternatives to addressed this, Christie wants to go with Alternative 4
	* This service will not only serve MDS, it will also serve ...
	* Other services. Currently many services are tracking robot state, and have to join the data from multiple places. If we can have all of that be unified, that would make our lives easier. 
* For the fleet service, there's events that it's reading frm downstream of the IoT service, and directly from the IoT service, and it tries to reconcile these two data sources to piece together the state of the robot, but that's annoying
* The device will only emit the delta in the events, so if there's missing events, we can enter a weird state
* We also have some out of order events causing us to enter a bad state
* We want to expose a gRPC endpoint
