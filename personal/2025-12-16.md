* Investigating the lid events for lid cycles that don't successfully end
* Meeting with Christie to talk about the device API project

## Notes about lid event pages
* we're getting 10-15 pages for lids dont get closed, or it gets closed but the delivery is already canceled 
* lid cycle is the software flow for doordash loads, pin-to-unlock (AKA two-digit)
* there's also QR, which is reliable
* the uber flow is that it's deviceless called magiclid, so we set the robot into a certain state when the bot arrives
	* can take a look at rafa's doc about loading
	* magic lid flow doesn't go through the lid events, it mostly goes through the delivery service, but Rafa extended the implementation to avoid false positives, using the lid cycles
	* should focus on raw device events
	* we want to validate first and foremost if this is a real issues, or a data processing issue 
	* if it's uber and a failure, it's likely magic lid
	* for doordash, you can check the load type
	* Rafa started going through them one-by-one 
	TODOs:
	* get the sevs, find distribution of magiclid vs pin to unlock
	* Understand the magic lid flow and figure out why sometimes we don't mark the delivery as loaded
