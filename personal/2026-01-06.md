* migrating of drive u
* needed to create the terraform template
	* part of that invovles creating the node pool and the dns records 
	* creating ecr for their images
	* we have a script that pulls the latest images from the drive u ECR
* they gave us env files from which we created config maps
* when deploying "resource oversight", we had issues, it was being deployed with arm64 but we need amd64
	* we needed to patch the config so that it only gets picked up by amd64 nodes
	* had to create a separate node pool for that
* had to update state and device to update the URL to point to dlc.cocodelivery
* Open question
	* Where do we store the keys for tcopying from drive U's ECR
