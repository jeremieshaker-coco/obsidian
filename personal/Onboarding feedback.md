Overall I’m really happy to be here and I’ve learned a ton already. As I’ve been onboarding, I’ve run into a few things that made it a bit hard to get fully productive, and I wanted to share in case it helps improve the experience going forward.

The codebase is quite large and complex — which makes sense — but it’s sometimes tough to trace logic because of long functions, inconsistent naming, and limited tests. I’ve also noticed the logging and metrics are used differently across places, which makes debugging a bit tricky.

On the process side, PR reviews can take a while, and Slack isn’t used much for async questions — so sometimes it’s hard to get feedback or context quickly. And a lot of the expected behavior isn’t clearly documented, which makes it harder to be confident in changes.

I’ve also realized I probably over-refactored early on — I wanted to clean things up, but I think I went beyond what was expected. I’d love to get clearer guidance on when to optimize for speed versus correctness or design.

If I could make a few small suggestions: more consistent tests and logging patterns, clearer expectations for tasks, and maybe assigning onboarding buddies for new hires. Those would have helped me ramp up faster.

I really want to help improve these things over time — I’m not trying to criticize, just hoping to make things smoother for me and future engineers.
