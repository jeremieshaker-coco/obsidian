Can you do deep research about "the life of a robot", write it in the directory obsidian/research, and you can borrow inspiration from @obsidian/research/THE_LIFE_OF_AN_ORDER.md.

  

Things im thinking about is how the robots need to be deployed, whether it's through a deployment trip or being physically dropped off by someone driving a van (not sure if it's FOs or someone else), they emit heartbeats (reporting on a bunch of statuses, location, etc), they get assigned trips, a pilot connects, some things might interrupt their trip, or if not interrupted maybe they eventually they get to destination, the pilot marks it as complete, and then somehow a new trip appears, so like filling in the blanks, and like how a robot might have a few trips scheduled in advanced, how they might get cancelled, how they might become unhealthy, a component might break, how an FO might have to come empty the bot. also include details about the types of trips, and how the robot will get loaded with food by the merchant, how the customer will open the bot, take their food, and then close it again, and included all the ways that it can go wrong along the way. and then i think maybe at the end of the day a bot will get picked up or deployed to storage unit or something? and they also need to get their batteries swapped if their battery falls below a threshold, so maybe also include how that happens.
