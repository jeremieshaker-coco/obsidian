# Deployment Communication Policy

Clear communication is key when deploying changes.

## When to Communicate

-   **Small Changes**: For small, low-impact changes, no formal announcement is necessary.
-   **Large Changes**: For larger updates that may impact other teams or the product, an announcement should be made.

## How to Communicate

-   **Slack Channel**: The `#product-updates` Slack channel should be used for communicating larger deployments. This channel is visible to other parts of the company.
-   **Content of the Announcement**: When posting in `#product-updates`, include the following:
    -   The impact of the change from a product perspective.
    -   Any potential risks.
    -   Tag relevant stakeholders (e.g., Product Managers, General Managers).

## Timing for First-Time Deployments

If you are deploying for the first time, it is a good practice to do it around 5 PM your time, so that team members in PST are available to provide support if needed.
