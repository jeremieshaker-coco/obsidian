# Heartbeat

A heartbeat is a periodic signal generated by a hardware or software component to indicate its normal operation or to synchronize other parts of a system.

In this project, heartbeats are used to:
- Monitor the health and status of robots and their components.
- Ensure that connections are alive.
- Trigger actions based on the presence or absence of a heartbeat.

Different types of heartbeats exist within the system:
- [[Active Robot Heartbeat]]
- [[Robot Component Heartbeats]]
